# GameMusicRepo
A repository filled with my experimental music creation

The first three tracks laballed Tracks 1, 2, and 3 are apart of an indie video game project I am working on.


Track 1
This track is a meant to ilustrate the increasing tension and fear within a player as they slowly complete objectives to reach their goal. The music is meant to impose as a threatening actor, meant to distill unease and fear within the player.

Track 2
This track is meant to elevate the intense but exhilerating feeling within a player during a special encounter with a character from a personal indie project. It is meant to replicate a boss fight, while enforcing the idea that the player cannot fight back and simply must evade their fate.

Track 3
A more melodic, ethereal approach was taken for this particular segment, meant to emphasize a co-operative approach with the particular character player's must face. It is meant to place a layer of calm over the player's; a diversion from their usual stressful endeavours.
